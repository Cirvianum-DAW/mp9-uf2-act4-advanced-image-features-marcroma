        Why is the alt attribute important for images? Write a brief explanation
        in the HTML file.
      </h1>
      <p>
        The alt attribute in HTML is important for images because it provides
        alternative text that is displayed when the image cannot be loaded or
        when the user is using a screen reader. It ensures that visually
        impaired users can understand the content of the image, improving
        accessibility, while also providing descriptive and relevant alternative
        text , improving the visibility of the website in search engine results.
